Dataset : Concrete Compressive Strength

Domain : Material manufacturing

Description: The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled).The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).

Objective : Modeling of strength of high performance concrete using Machine Learning

Steps : This project involved feature exploration and selection to predict the strength of high-performance concrete. Used Regression models like Decision tree regressors to find out the most important features and predict the strength. Cross-validation techniques and Grid search were used to tune the parameters for best model performance.

Skills and Tools : Regression, Decision trees, feature engineering
